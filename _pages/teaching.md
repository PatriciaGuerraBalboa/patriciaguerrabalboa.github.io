## Lectures
### Organizer and Lecturer of Privacy and Security Seminar <a href="https://ps.tm.kit.edu/english/139_1012.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Course Webpage)</a>

**Period:** Every winter semester from 2022-2025  

**Description:** In this seminar, master students explore selected topics in privacy and security. Throughout the semester, they write a short seminar paper, present their findings to peers, and participate in group discussions. The course focuses on developing: Technical knowledge across diverse areas of security and privacy, fundamental skills in academic research and scientific writing and understanding of the scientific process, including conferences and peer review.

###  Lecurer of Privacy Enhancing Technologies  <a href="https://ps.tm.kit.edu/139_965.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Course Webpage)</a>
**Period:** Every summer semester from 2022-2025 

**Description:** This master course teaches the students a basic understanding of the risks for their privacy, the most common technologies to enhance privacy ("PETS") and the human factors that shape their design. The course analyses the models and metrics under which PETS are designed and evaluated. I'm the lecture of Module 5 - Differential privacy.

### Teaching Assistant of Privacy Enhancing Technologies Reading Group <a href="https://ps.tm.kit.edu/english/139_968.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Course Webpage)</a>
**Period:** Every summer semester 2023-2025

**Description:** Exercise course complementary to PETs Lecture where students participate in a biweekly reading group, discussing key papers related to the lecture topics, with volunteers summarizing each paper. Additionally, students complete a hands-on implementation task: designing a simple data-sharing solution using differential privacy. Results are presented and discussed in the final session.
