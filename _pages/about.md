Hi! I'm a PhD student at the Privacy & Security Chair at KIT, in Germany. My background is in Mathematics. 
My current research interests lie in privacy-preserving data analysis, with a strong focus on Differential Privacy and location data.
I do not only like doing research, but also talking about it to both scientific and general audiences.
