Before starting my PhD, I obtained both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Mathematics from the University of Santiago de Compostela (USC), Spain.
During my bachelor’s thesis, supervised by Antonio Gómez Tato and Leovigildo Alonso Tarrio, I explored Category Theory, Sheaf Theory, and Topology on Simplicial Complexes, applying these abstract concepts to air traffic control. I loved this project not only for its deep mathematical content, but because it showed me how pure theory can have a real-world impact — and ultimately motivated me to pursue a research career that contributes to society.

Following that decision, I devoted myself fully to research. During my Master’s, I earned top grades and distinctions, took part in the Research Introduction Seminar (S.I.I.) — both as a participant and as a teaching assistant — and worked as a pre-doctoral researcher on short-term projects at USC (with Leovigildo Alonso and Ana Geremías) and at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC) (with Javier Parra Arnau and Jordi Forné).

It was during my time at UPC that I first discovered Differential Privacy, which inspired me to pursue a PhD in this field. I then moved to Germany to begin my doctoral studies at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) under the supervision of Prof. Thorsten Strufe, focusing on privacy-enhancing technologies. My current research centers on differential privacy (DP) techniques and their formal analysis. Specifically, My current research centers on differential privacy techniques and their formal analysis. In particular, I work on:

 - Adversarial resilience of DP, including the impact of data correlations on privacy guarantees and the interpretability of DP parameters as a countermeasure against existing attacks,

 - Composition properties of DP, and

 - Applications of DP to streaming and location privacy.

As part of this work, I joined the CyberSec Graduate School, which has given me the opportunity to collaborate with interdisciplinary researchers from fields such as machine learning security and human-centered security.

Although my research leans toward the theoretical side of privacy — I’m a mathematician at heart — I care deeply about making science accessible and impactful. This led me to explore science communication, participating in the national FameLab competition, where I won the silver medal at the regional level and qualified for the national finals. It was a fun and formative experience that strengthened my passion for outreach.
I’m always open to new opportunities for science communication or public engagement — so if you’re organizing something along those lines, feel free to reach out!
