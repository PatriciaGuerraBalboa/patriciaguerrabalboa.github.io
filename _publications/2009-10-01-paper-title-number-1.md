title: "Balancing Privacy and Utility in Correlated Data: A Study of Bayesian Differential Privacy"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'In this work we tackle a key challenge in privacy-preserving data analysis: real-world datasets often have correlations, and standard Differential Privacy doesn not naturally prevent leaks arising from them. We explore Bayesian Differential Privacy, providing both theoretical insights and practical tools to design mechanisms that:
 ✅ maintain strong privacy guarantees,
 ✅ preserve utility for Markov chains and multivariate Gaussian distributions.'
